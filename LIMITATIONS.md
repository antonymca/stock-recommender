# Limitations

- All data sources rely on free or freemium APIs.  They can be rate limited or
  delayed relative to realâ€‘time feeds.
- The QVM model implemented here is a simplified placeholder and does not yet
  include macro overlays, risk management or option strategies.
- Jobs and backtests are scaffolds only and will need fleshing out before use in
  production or research workflows.
